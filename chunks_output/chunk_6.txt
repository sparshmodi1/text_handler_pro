that accessed up to 16 memory modules through a crossbar switch.[83] In 1967, Amdahl and Slotnick published a debate
about the feasibility of parallel processing at American Federation of Information Processing Societies Conference.
[82] It was during this debate that Amdahl's law was coined to define the limit of speed-up due to parallelism.
In 1969, Honeywell introduced its first Multics system, a symmetric multiprocessor system capable of running up to eight processors in parallel.[82] C.mmp, a multi-processor project at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1970s, was
among the first multiprocessors with more than a few processors. The first bus-connected multiprocessor with snooping
caches was the Synapse N+1 in 1984.[76]

SIMD parallel computers can be traced back to the 1970s. The motivation behind early SIMD computers was to amortize
the gate delay of the processor's control unit over multiple instructions.[84] In 1964, Slotnick had proposed
building a massively parallel computer for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.[82] His design was funded by
the US Air Force, which was the earliest SIMD parallel-computing effort, ILLIAC IV.[82] The key to its design was a
fairly high parallelism, with up to 256 processors, which allowed the machine to work on large datasets in what would
later be known as vector processing. However, ILLIAC IV was called "the most infamous of supercomputers", because the
project was only one-fourth completed, but took 11 years and cost almost four times the original estimate.[74] When
it was finally ready to run its first real application in 1976, it was outperformed by existing commercial supercomputers such as the Cray-1.

On 25 October 2004 McIntyre posted comments on climate2003.com about a piece by William Connolley circulated on
various blogs, and on 26 October wrote, "Maybe I’ll start blogging some odds and ends that I’m working on. I’m going
to post up some more observations on some of the blog criticisms."[7] On 1 December Michael E. Mann and nine other
scientists launched the RealClimate website as "a resource where the public can go to see what actual scientists
working in the field have to say about the latest issues."[8] On climate2003.com McIntyre noted this development in a
blog post on 10 December, where he wrote "Mann and some of his colleagues have set up a blog at the above address. A
couple of Mann's first postings have been arguments against our papers. I'll post up a two quick comments below."[7]
On 2 February 2005 McIntyre set up his Climate Audit blog, having found difficulties with posting comments on the
climate2003.com layout.[
After the UK Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) came into effect in 2005, Climate Audit readers were asked to make FOI
requests to the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (UEA) for the raw data from weather
stations used in developing instrumental temperature record datasets, for copies of agreements under which the raw
data was obtained from meteorology institutions, and also for email correspondence relating to the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report.[11] On 12 August 2009, Olive Heffernan wrote in naturenews that
"Since 2002, Steve McIntyre, the editor of Climate Audit, a blog that investigates the statistical methods used in
climate science, has repeatedly asked Phil Jones, director of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of

East Anglia, UK, for access to monthly global surface temperature data held by the institute. But in recent weeks,
Jones has been swamped by a sudden surge in demands for data". She described how CRU had received 58 FOIA requests
between 24 and 29 July 2009 from McIntyre or others associated with the blog. The raw data was restricted to
academics, and the unit's director Phil Jones said that the data was subject to confidentiality agreements with
various governments, but he was seeking agreement to get the raw data available online. He said that “Data release
needs to be done in a systematic way.”[12]
The site was one of the first to receive word of the e-mails which had been leaked[13][14][15] from the University of
East Anglia with Jonathan Leake of The Times writing, "The storm began with just four cryptic words. 'A miracle has
happened,' announced a contributor to Climate Audit, a website devoted to criticising the science of climate change."
[16] Louise Gray wrote in The Daily Telegraph, "Climate Audit was one of the first to post up the stolen emails from
the University of East Anglia that led to the 'climategate' scandal".[17]
Bloomberg said of the controversy, "Web sites and blogs including the Climate Audit Mirror Site have carried copies
of e-mails, correspondence between climatologists and commentary. In one e-mail cited widely on blogs including
Climate Audit, Phil Jones writes about completing “Mike’s nature trick of adding in the real temps” in order to hide
the decline."[18] According to Antonio Regalado writing in Science Insider, Jones wrote e-mails stating that he
convinced the university's FOI managers to not release data to "greenhouse skeptics" because Jones believed that they
planned to harm the UEA or setback climate science by drawing scientists into disputes, wasting research time.[19]
"Think I've managed to persuade UEA to ignore all further FOIA requests if the people have anything to do with
Climate Audit," Jones wrote in 2007.[19] The House of Commons' Science and Technology Committee largely vindicated
the scientists involved in the scandal, but left consideration of the quality of the science and the conduct of the
research to committees chaired by Lord Oxburgh and Sir Muir Russell. Fox News said that McIntyre "who also worked at
the IPCC and submitted notes to the Science and Technology Committee for its investigation, wrote a lengthy rebuttal
of the decision on his blog", and disputed the committee's conclusion that the word trick "appears to be a
colloquialism for a 'neat' method of handling data".[20] Further investigations by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency, the Inspector General of the United States Department of Commerce and the Office of the Inspector
General (OIG) of the National Science Foundation reaffirmed that the accusations against the scientists were
