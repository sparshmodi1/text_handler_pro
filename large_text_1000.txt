A couple weeks ago there was this news about the Nano editor no longer being part of the GNU project. My first 
reaction was, wow people still really care about an old editor which is a clone of an editor originally part of a 
terminal based EMAIL CLIENT. Let’s say this again, “email client”. The notion of email client itself is gone at this 
point, everything changed. And yet I read, on Hacker News, a number of people writing how they were often saved by 
the availability of nano on random systems, doing system administrator tasks, for example. Nano is also how my son 
wrote his first program in C. It’s an acceptable experience that does not require past experience editing files.
This is how I started to think about writing a text editor ways smaller than Nano itself. Just for fun, basically, 
because I like and admire small programs.
How lame, useless, wasting of time is today writing an editor? We are supposed to write shiny incredible projects, 
very cool, very complex, valuable stuff. But sometimes to make things without a clear purpose is refreshing. There 
were also memories…
I remember my first experiences with the Commodore 16 in-ROM assembler, and all the home computers and BASIC 
interpreters I used later in my child life. An editor is a fundamental connection between the human and the machine. 
It allows the human to write something that the computer can interpret. The blinking of a square prompt is something 
that many of us will never forget.
Well, all nice, but my time was very limited. A few hours across two weekends with programmed family activities and 
meat to prepare for friends in long barbecue sessions. Maybe I could still write an editor on a few spare hours with 
some trick. My goal was to write an editor which was very small, no curses, and with syntax highlighting. Something 
usable, basically. That’s the deal.. It’s little stuff, but is already hard to write all this from scratch in a few 
hours.But … wait, I actually wrote an editor in the past, is part of the LOAD81 project, a Lua based programming 
environment for children. Maybe I can just reuse it… and instead of using SDL to write on the screen what about 
sending VT100 escape sequences directly to the terminal? And I’ve code for this as well in linenoise, another toy 
project that eventually found its place in some may other serious projects. So maybe mixing the two…
The first week Saturday morning I went to the sea, and it was great. Later my brother arrived from Edinburg to 
Catania, and at the end of the day we were together in the garden with our laptops, trying to defend ourselves from 
the 30 degrees that there were during the day, so I started to hack the first skeleton of the editor. The LOAD81 code 
was quite modular, to take it away from the original project was a joke. I could kinda edit after a few hours, and it 
was already time to go bed. The next day I worked again at it before leaving for the sea again. My 15yo sleeps till 
1pm, as I did when I was 15yo in summertime after all, so I coded more in sprints of 30 minutes waiting for him to 
get up, using the rest of the time to play with my wonderful daughter. Finally later in the Sunday night I tried to 
fix all the remaining stuff.
Hey I remember that a few years ago to hack on a project was, to *hack* on it, full time for days. I’m old now, but 
still young enough to write toy editors and consider it a serious business :-)
However life is hard, and Monday arrived. Real business, no time for toy projects, not even time to release what I 
got during the weekend… It deserved some minimal polishing and a blog post.
I had to wait this Monday to put my hands on the “Kilo” editor again. It’s called Kilo because it has less than 1024 
lines of code. The “cloc” utility, used in order to count the number of lines of code, signaled me I still had ~100 
lines of space before reaching 1024 LOC, and a serious editor needs a “search” feature after all. So back to the 
code, trying also to restructure and recomment it a bit, since you know, when you mix two projects pieces in a few 
hours the risk is that the code quality is less than excellent.
Well, now it’s time to release it, end of this crazy project. Maybe somebody will use it as a starting point to write 
a real editor, or maybe it could be used to write some new interesting CLI that goes over the usual REPL style model.
Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or processes are carried out simultaneously.
[1] Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are 
several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism 
has long been employed in high-performance computing, but has gained broader interest due to the physical constraints 
preventing frequency scaling.[2] As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a 
concern in recent years,[3] parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in 
the form of multi-core processors.[4]
Parallelism vs concurrencyIn computer science, parallelism and concurrency are two different things: a parallel 
program uses multiple CPU cores, each core performing a task independently. On the other hand, concurrency enables a 
program to deal with multiple tasks even on a single CPU core; the core switches between tasks (i.e. threads) without 
necessarily completing each one. A program can have both, neither or a combination of parallelism and concurrency 
characteristics.Parallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the hardware supports 
parallelism, with multi-core and multi-processor computers having multiple processing elements within a single 
machine, while clusters, MPPs, and grids use multiple computers to work on the same task. Specialized parallel 
computer architectures are sometimes used alongside traditional processors, for accelerating specific tasks.
In some cases parallelism is transparent to the programmer, such as in bit-level or instruction-level parallelism, 
but explicitly parallel algorithms, particularly those that use concurrency, are more difficult to write than 
sequential ones,[6] because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential software bugs, of which race 
conditions are the most common. Communication and synchronization between the different subtasks are typically some 
of the greatest obstacles to getting optimal parallel program performance.
A theoretical upper bound on the speed-up of a single program as a result of parallelization is given by Amdahl's 
law, which states that it is limited by the fraction of time for which the parallelization can be utilised.
Background
Traditionally, computer software has been written for serial computation. To solve a problem, an algorithm is 
constructed and implemented as a serial stream of instructions. These instructions are executed on a central 
processing unit on one computer. Only one instruction may execute at a time—after that instruction is finished, the 
next one is executed.[7]

Parallel computing, on the other hand, uses multiple processing elements simultaneously to solve a problem. This is 
accomplished by breaking the problem into independent parts so that each processing element can execute its part of 
the algorithm simultaneously with the others. The processing elements can be diverse and include resources such as a 
single computer with multiple processors, several networked computers, specialized hardware, or any combination of 
the above.[7] Historically parallel computing was used for scientific computing and the simulation of scientific 
problems, particularly in the natural and engineering sciences, such as meteorology. This led to the design of 
parallel hardware and software, and high performance computing.[8]
Frequency scaling was the dominant reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004. The 
runtime of a program is equal to the number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction. 
Maintaining everything else constant, increasing the clock frequency decreases the average time it takes to execute 
an instruction. An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime for all compute-bound programs.[9] However, power 
consumption P by a chip is given by the equation P = C × V 2 × F, where C is the capacitance being switched per clock 
cycle (proportional to the number of transistors whose inputs change), V is voltage, and F is the processor frequency 
(cycles per second).[10] Increases in frequency increase the amount of power used in a processor. Increasing 
processor power consumption led ultimately to Intel's May 8, 2004 cancellation of its Tejas and Jayhawk processors, 
which is generally cited as the end of frequency scaling as the dominant computer architecture paradigm.[11]
To deal with the problem of power consumption and overheating the major central processing unit (CPU or processor) 
manufacturers started to produce power efficient processors with multiple cores. The core is the computing unit of 
the processor and in multi-core processors each core is independent and can access the same memory concurrently. 
Multi-core processors have brought parallel computing to desktop computers. Thus parallelization of serial programs 
has become a mainstream programming task. In 2012 quad-core processors became standard for desktop computers, while 
servers had 10+ core processors. Moore's law predicted that the number of cores per processor would double every 
18–24 months.[12] By 2023 some processors had over hundred cores. Some designs having a mix of performance and 
efficiency cores (such as ARM's big.LITTLE design) due to thermal and design constraints.[citation needed]
An operating system can ensure that different tasks and user programs are run in parallel on the available cores. 
However, for a serial software program to take full advantage of the multi-core architecture the programmer needs to 
restructure and parallelize the code. A speed-up of application software runtime will no longer be achieved through 
frequency scaling, instead programmers will need to parallelize their software code to take advantage of the 
increasing computing power of multicore architectures.[13]
Relevant laws
A graphical representation of Amdahl's law. The law demonstrates the theoretical maximum speedup of an overall system 
and the concept of diminishing returns. If exactly 50% of the work can be parallelized, the best possible speedup is 
2 times. If 95% of the work can be parallelized, the best possible speedup is 20 times. According to the law, even 
with an infinite number of processors, the speedup is constrained by the unparallelizable portion.
Assume that a task has two independent parts, A and B. Part B takes roughly 25% of the time of the whole computation. 
By working very hard, one may be able to make this part 5 times faster, but this only reduces the time for the whole 
computation by a little. In contrast, one may need to perform less work to make part A twice as fast. This will make 
the computation much faster than by optimizing part B, even though part B's speedup is greater by ratio, (5 times 
versus 2 times).
Main article: Amdahl's law
Optimally, the speedup from parallelization would be linear—doubling the number of processing elements should halve 
the runtime, and doubling it a second time should again halve the runtime. However, very few parallel algorithms 
achieve optimal speedup. Most of them have a near-linear speedup for small numbers of processing elements, which 
flattens out into a constant value for large numbers of processing elements.

The maximum potential speedup of an overall system can be calculated by Amdahl's law.[14] Amdahl's Law indicates that
optimal performance improvement is achieved by balancing enhancements to both parallelizable and non-parallelizable 
components of a task. Furthermore, it reveals that increasing the number of processors yields diminishing returns, 
with negligible speedup gains beyond a certain point.[15][16]
Amdahl's Law has limitations, including assumptions of fixed workload, neglecting inter-process communication and 
synchronization overheads, primarily focusing on computational aspect and ignoring extrinsic factors such as data 
persistence, I/O operations, and memory access overheads.[17][18][19]
Gustafson's law and Universal Scalability Law give a more realistic assessment of the parallel performance.[20][21]
A graphical representation of Gustafson's law
Dependencies
Understanding data dependencies is fundamental in implementing parallel algorithms. No program can run more quickly 
than the longest chain of dependent calculations (known as the critical path), since calculations that depend upon 
prior calculations in the chain must be executed in order. However, most algorithms do not consist of just a long 
chain of dependent calculations; there are usually opportunities to execute independent calculations in parallel.
Let Pi and Pj be two program segments. Bernstein's conditions[22] describe when the two are independent and can be 
executed in parallel. For Pi, let Ii be all of the input variables and Oi the output variables, and likewise for Pj. 
Pi and Pj are independent if they satisfy
Violation of the first condition introduces a flow dependency, corresponding to the first segment producing a result 
used by the second segment. The second condition represents an anti-dependency, when the second segment produces a 
variable needed by the first segment. The third and final condition represents an output dependency: when two 
segments write to the same location, the result comes from the logically last executed segment.[23]
Consider the following functions, which demonstrate several kinds of dependencies:
In this example, instruction 3 cannot be executed before (or even in parallel with) instruction 2, because 
instruction 3 uses a result from instruction 2. It violates condition 1, and thus introduces a flow dependency.
In this example, there are no dependencies between the instructions, so they can all be run in parallel.
Bernstein's conditions do not allow memory to be shared between different processes. For that, some means of 
enforcing an ordering between accesses is necessary, such as semaphores, barriers or some other synchronization 
method.
Race conditions, mutual exclusion, synchronization, and parallel slowdown
Subtasks in a parallel program are often called threads. Some parallel computer architectures use smaller, 
lightweight versions of threads known as fibers, while others use bigger versions known as processes. However, 
"threads" is generally accepted as a generic term for subtasks.[24] Threads will often need synchronized access to an 
object or other resource, for example when they must update a variable that is shared between them. Without 
synchronization, the instructions between the two threads may be interleaved in any order. For example, consider the 
following program:
Thread A	Thread B
1A: Read variable V	1B: Read variable V
2A: Add 1 to variable V	2B: Add 1 to variable V
3A: Write back to variable V	3B: Write back to variable V
If instruction 1B is executed between 1A and 3A, or if instruction 1A is executed between 1B and 3B, the program will 
produce incorrect data. This is known as a race condition. The programmer must use a lock to provide mutual 
exclusion. A lock is a programming language construct that allows one thread to take control of a variable and 
prevent other threads from reading or writing it, until that variable is unlocked. The thread holding the lock is 
free to execute its critical section (the section of a program that requires exclusive access to some variable), and 
to unlock the data when it is finished. Therefore, to guarantee correct program execution, the above program can be 
rewritten to use locks:
Thread A	Thread B
1A: Lock variable V	1B: Lock variable V
2A: Read variable V	2B: Read variable V
3A: Add 1 to variable V	3B: Add 1 to variable V
4A: Write back to variable V	4B: Write back to variable V
5A: Unlock variable V	5B: Unlock variable V
One thread will successfully lock variable V, while the other thread will be locked out—unable to proceed until V is 
unlocked again. This guarantees correct execution of the program. Locks may be necessary to ensure correct program 
execution when threads must serialize access to resources, but their use can greatly slow a program and may affect 
its reliability.[25]
Locking multiple variables using non-atomic locks introduces the possibility of program deadlock. An atomic lock 
locks multiple variables all at once. If it cannot lock all of them, it does not lock any of them. If two threads 
each need to lock the same two variables using non-atomic locks, it is possible that one thread will lock one of them 
and the second thread will lock the second variable. In such a case, neither thread can complete, and deadlock 
results.[26]
Many parallel programs require that their subtasks act in synchrony. This requires the use of a barrier. Barriers are 
typically implemented using a lock or a semaphore.[27] One class of algorithms, known as lock-free and wait-free 
algorithms, altogether avoids the use of locks and barriers. However, this approach is generally difficult to 
implement and requires correctly designed data structures.[28]
Not all parallelization results in speed-up. Generally, as a task is split up into more and more threads, those 
threads spend an ever-increasing portion of their time communicating with each other or waiting on each other for 
access to resources.[29][30] Once the overhead from resource contention or communication dominates the time spent on 
other computation, further parallelization (that is, splitting the workload over even more threads) increases rather 
than decreases the amount of time required to finish. This problem, known as parallel slowdown,[31] can be improved 
in some cases by software analysis and redesign.[32]
Fine-grained, coarse-grained, and embarrassing parallelism
Applications are often classified according to how often their subtasks need to synchronize or communicate with each 
other. An application exhibits fine-grained parallelism if its subtasks must communicate many times per second; it 
exhibits coarse-grained parallelism if they do not communicate many times per second, and it exhibits embarrassing 
parallelism if they rarely or never have to communicate. Embarrassingly parallel applications are considered the 
easiest to parallelize.Flynn's taxonomyMain article: Flynn's taxonomy

Michael J. Flynn created one of the earliest classification systems for parallel (and sequential) computers and 
programs, now known as Flynn's taxonomy. Flynn classified programs and computers by whether they were operating using 
a single set or multiple sets of instructions, and whether or not those instructions were using a single set or 
multiple sets of data.Flynn's taxonomySingle data streamSISDMISDMultiple data streamsSIMDMIMDSIMD subcategories[33]

Array processing (SIMT)Pipelined processing (packed SIMD)Associative processing (predicated/masked SIMD)See also

SPMDMPMDThe single-instruction-single-data (SISD) classification is equivalent to an entirely sequential program. The 
single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) classification is analogous to doing the same operation repeatedly over a 
large data set. This is commonly done in signal processing applications. Multiple-instruction-single-data (MISD) is a 
rarely used classification. While computer architectures to deal with this were devised (such as systolic arrays), 
few applications that fit this class materialized. Multiple-instruction-multiple-data (MIMD) programs are by far the 
most common type of parallel programs.

According to David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy, "Some machines are hybrids of these categories, of course, but 
this classic model has survived because it is simple, easy to understand, and gives a good first approximation. It is 
also—perhaps because of its understandability—the most widely used scheme."[34]
DisadvantagesParallel computing can incur significant overhead in practice, primarily due to the costs associated 
with merging data from multiple processes. Specifically, inter-process communication and synchronization can lead to 
overheads that are substantially higher—often by two or more orders of magnitude—compared to processing the same data 
on a single thread.[35][36][37] Therefore, the overall improvement should be carefully evaluated.GranularityBit-level 
parallelismMain article: Bit-level parallelismTaiwania 3 of Taiwan, a parallel supercomputing device that joined 
COVID-19 researchFrom the advent of very-large-scale integration (VLSI) computer-chip fabrication technology in the 
1970s until about 1986, speed-up in computer architecture was driven by doubling computer word size—the amount of 
information the processor can manipulate per cycle.[38] Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions 
the processor must execute to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than the length of the word. 
For example, where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers, the processor must first add the 8 lower-order 
bits from each integer using the standard addition instruction, then add the 8 higher-order bits using an 
add-with-carry instruction and the carry bit from the lower order addition; thus, an 8-bit processor requires two 
instructions to complete a single operation, where a 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with a 
single instruction.Historically, 4-bit microprocessors were replaced with 8-bit, then 16-bit, then 32-bit 
microprocessors. This trend generally came to an end with the introduction of 32-bit processors, which has been a 
standard in general-purpose computing for two decades. Not until the early 2000s, with the advent of x86-64 
architectures, did 64-bit processors become commonplace.Instruction-level parallelismMain article: Instruction-level 
parallelismA canonical processor without pipeline. It takes five clock cycles to complete one instruction and thus 
the processor can issue subscalar performance (IPC = 0.2 < 1).

A computer program is, in essence, a stream of instructions executed by a processor. Without instruction-level 
parallelism, a processor can only issue less than one instruction per clock cycle (IPC < 1). These processors are 
known as subscalar processors. These instructions can be re-ordered and combined into groups which are then executed 
in parallel without changing the result of the program. This is known as instruction-level parallelism. Advances in 
instruction-level parallelism dominated computer architecture from the mid-1980s until the mid-1990s.[39]

A canonical five-stage pipelined processor. In the best case scenario, it takes one clock cycle to complete one 
instruction and thus the processor can issue scalar performance (IPC = 1).

All modern processors have multi-stage instruction pipelines. Each stage in the pipeline corresponds to a different 
action the processor performs on that instruction in that stage; a processor with an N-stage pipeline can have up to 
N different instructions at different stages of completion and thus can issue one instruction per clock cycle (IPC = 
1). These processors are known as scalar processors. The canonical example of a pipelined processor is a RISC 
processor, with five stages: instruction fetch (IF), instruction decode (ID), execute (EX), memory access (MEM), and 
register write back (WB). The Pentium 4 processor had a 35-stage pipeline.[40]

A canonical five-stage pipelined processor with two execution units. In the best case scenario, it takes one clock 
cycle to complete two instructions and thus the processor can issue superscalar performance (IPC = 2 > 1).

Most modern processors also have multiple execution units. They usually combine this feature with pipelining and thus 
can issue more than one instruction per clock cycle (IPC > 1). These processors are known as superscalar processors. 
Superscalar processors differ from multi-core processors in that the several execution units are not entire 
processors (i.e. processing units). Instructions can be grouped together only if there is no data dependency between 
them. Scoreboarding and the Tomasulo algorithm (which is similar to scoreboarding but makes use of register renaming) 
are two of the most common techniques for implementing out-of-order execution and instruction-level parallelism.

Task parallelismMain article: Task parallelismTask parallelisms is the characteristic of a parallel program that 

"entirely different calculations can be performed on either the same or different sets of data".[41] This contrasts 
with data parallelism, where the same calculation is performed on the same or different sets of data. Task 
parallelism involves the decomposition of a task into sub-tasks and then allocating each sub-task to a processor for 
execution. The processors would then execute these sub-tasks concurrently and often cooperatively. Task parallelism 

does not usually scale with the size of a problem.Superword level parallelismSuperword level parallelism is a 
vectorization technique based on loop unrolling and basic block vectorization. It is distinct from loop vectorization 
algorithms in that it can exploit parallelism of inline code, such as manipulating coordinates, color channels or in 

loops unrolled by hand.[43]

HardwareMemory and communicationMain memory in a parallel computer is either shared memory (shared between all 
processing elements in a single address space), or distributed memory (in which each processing element has its own 

local address space).[44] Distributed memory refers to the fact that the memory is logically distributed, but often 
implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared memory and memory virtualization combine the 
two approaches, where the processing element has its own local memory and access to the memory on non-local 
processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory. On the supercomputers, 
distributed shared memory space can be implemented using the programming model such as PGAS. This model allows 
processes on one compute node to transparently access the remote memory of another compute node. All compute nodes 
are also connected to an external shared memory system via high-speed interconnect, such as Infiniband, this external 
shared memory system is known as burst buffer, which is typically built from arrays of non-volatile memory physically 
distributed across multiple I/O nodes.

A logical view of a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture. Processors in one directory can access that 
directory's memory with less latency than they can access memory in the other directory's memory.
Computer architectures in which each element of main memory can be accessed with equal latency and bandwidth are 
known as uniform memory access (UMA) systems. Typically, that can be achieved only by a shared memory system, in 

which the memory is not physically distributed. A system that does not have this property is known as a non-uniform 
memory access (NUMA) architecture. Distributed memory systems have non-uniform memory access.

Computer systems make use of caches—small and fast memories located close to the processor which store temporary 
copies of memory values (nearby in both the physical and logical sense). Parallel computer systems have difficulties 
with caches that may store the same value in more than one location, with the possibility of incorrect program 
execution. These computers require a cache coherency system, which keeps track of cached values and strategically 
purges them, thus ensuring correct program execution. Bus snooping is one of the most common methods for keeping 
track of which values are being accessed (and thus should be purged). Designing large, high-performance cache 
coherence systems is a very difficult problem in computer architecture. As a result, shared memory computer 
architectures do not scale and distributed memory systems do.[44]

Processor–processor and processor–memory communication can be implemented in hardware in several ways, including via 
shared (either multiported or multiplexed) memory, a crossbar switch, a shared bus or an interconnect network of a 
myriad of topologies including star, ring, tree, hypercube, fat hypercube (a hypercube with more than one processor 
at a node), or n-dimensional mesh.

Parallel computers based on interconnected networks need to have some kind of routing to enable the passing of 
messages between nodes that are not directly connected. The medium used for communication between the processors is likely to be hierarchical in large multiprocessor machines.

Classes of parallel computersParallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism. This classification is broadly analogous to the distance between basic computing 
nodes. These are not mutually exclusive; for example, clusters of symmetric multiprocessors are relatively common.

Multi-core computingMain article: Multi-core processorA multi-core processor is a processor that includes multiple processing units (called "cores") on the same chip. This processor differs from a superscalar processor, which 

includes multiple execution units and can issue multiple instructions per clock cycle from one instruction stream (thread); in contrast, a multi-core processor can issue multiple instructions per clock cycle from multiple 
instruction streams. IBM's Cell microprocessor, designed for use in the Sony PlayStation 3, is a prominent multi-core 
processor. Each core in a multi-core processor can potentially be superscalar as well—that is, on every clock cycle, 
each core can issue multiple instructions from one thread.

Simultaneous multithreading (of which Intel's Hyper-Threading is the best known) was an early form of 
pseudo-multi-coreism. A processor capable of concurrent multithreading includes multiple execution units in the same 
processing unit—that is it has a superscalar architecture—and can issue multiple instructions per clock cycle from 
multiple threads. Temporal multithreading on the other hand includes a single execution unit in the same procesunit and can issue one instruction at a time from multiple threads.
Symmetric multiprocessingMain article: Symmetric multiprocessingA symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) is a computer system 
with multiple identical processors that share memory and connect via a bus.[45] Bus contention prevents bus 
architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32 processors.[46] Because of the 
small size of the processors and the significant reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved by large 
caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory 
bandwidth exists.[45]
Distributed computingMain article: Distributed computingA distributed computer (also known as a distributed memory 
multiprocessor) is a distributed memory computer system in which the processing elements are connected by a network. 
Distributed computers are highly scalable. The terms "concurrent computing", "parallel computing", and "distributed 

computing" have a lot of overlap, and no clear distinction exists between them.[47][48] The same system may be 
characterized both as "parallel" and "distributed"; the processors in a typical distributed system run concurrently 

in parallel.[49][50]

Cluster computingMain article: Computer clusterA Beowulf clusterA cluster is a group of loosely coupled computers 
that work together closely, so that in some respects they can be regarded as a single computer.[51] Clusters are 
composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster do not have to be 
symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, 
which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP 
Ethernet local area network.[52] Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. 
87% of all Top500 supercomputers are clusters.[53] The remaining are Massively Parallel Processors, explained below.


Because grid computing systems (described below) can easily handle embarrassingly parallel problems, modern clusters 
are typically designed to handle more difficult problems—problems that require nodes to share intermediate results 
with each other more often. This requires a high bandwidth and, more importantly, a low-latency interconnection 
network. Many historic and current supercomputers use customized high-performance network hardware specifically 
designed for cluster computing, such as the Cray Gemini network.[54] As of 2014, most current supercomputers use some 
off-the-shelf standard network hardware, often Myrinet, InfiniBand, or Gigabit Ethernet.


Massively parallel computingMain article: Massively parallel (computing)A cabinet from IBM's Blue Gene/L massively 
parallel supercomputerA massively parallel processor (MPP) is a single computer with many networked processors. MPPs 
have many of the same characteristics as clusters, but MPPs have specialized interconnect networks (whereas clusters 

use commodity hardware for networking). MPPs also tend to be larger than clusters, typically having "far more" than 
100 processors.[55] In an MPP, "each CPU contains its own memory and copy of the operating system and application. 
Each subsystem communicates with the others via a high-speed interconnect."[56]
IBM's Blue Gene/L, the fifth fastest supercomputer in the world according to the June 2009 TOP500 ranking, is an MPP.
Grid computingMain article: Grid computingGrid computing is the most distributed form of parallel computing. It makes 
use of computers communicating over the Internet to work on a given problem. Because of the low bandwidth and 
extremely high latency available on the Internet, distributed computing typically deals only with embarrassingly 
parallel problems.
Most grid computing applications use middleware (software that sits between the operating system and the application 
to manage network resources and standardize the software interface). The most common grid computing middleware is the 
Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC). Often volunteer computing software makes use of "spare 
cycles", performing computations at times when a computer is idling.[57]

Cloud computingMain article: Cloud computingThe ubiquity of the Internet and high-bandwidth networks enabled cloud 
computing, a model where massively parallel resources are provided as a service. This paradigm abstracts the 
underlying hardware, allowing users to access virtualized clusters for scalable workloads without managing physical 
infrastructure.
Distributed ledger technologyMain article: Distributed ledger technologyModern distributed ledger protocols apply 
parallel computing principles to overcome the sequential bottlenecks of traditional blockchains. By sharding the 
state space, newer consensus architectures allow for "massively parallel transaction processing". In this model, 
utilized by protocols such as Cerberus, independent transactions are treated as parallel tasks that can be executed 
simultaneously on different nodes, rather than being processed serially in a single global block.[58]
Specialized parallel computersWithin parallel computing, there are specialized parallel devices that remain niche 
areas of interest. While not domain-specific, they tend to be applicable to only a few classes of parallel problems.
Reconfigurable computing with field-programmable gate arrays
Reconfigurable computing is the use of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) as a co-processor to a general-purpose 
computer. An FPGA is, in essence, a computer chip that can rewire itself for a given task.
FPGAs can be programmed with hardware description languages such as VHDL[59] or Verilog.[60] Several vendors have 
created C to HDL languages that attempt to emulate the syntax and semantics of the C programming language, with which 
most programmers are familiar. The best known C to HDL languages are Mitrion-C, Impulse C, and Handel-C. Specific 
subsets of SystemC based on C++ can also be used for this purpose.
AMD's decision to open its HyperTransport technology to third-party vendors has become the enabling technology for 
high-performance reconfigurable computing.[61] According to Michael R. D'Amour, Chief Operating Officer of DRC 
Computer Corporation, "when we first walked into AMD, they called us 'the socket stealers.' Now they call us their 
partners."[61]
General-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU)Main article: GPGPU Nvidia's Tesla GPGPU card 
General-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) is a fairly recent trend in computer engineering 
research. GPUs are co-processors that have been heavily optimized for computer graphics processing.[62] Computer 
graphics processing is a field dominated by data parallel operations—particularly linear algebra matrix operations.In 
the early days, GPGPU programs used the normal graphics APIs for executing programs. However, several new programming 
languages and platforms have been built to do general purpose computation on GPUs with both Nvidia and AMD releasing 

programming environments with CUDA and Stream SDK respectively. Other GPU programming languages include BrookGPU, 
PeakStream, and RapidMind. Nvidia has also released specific products for computation in their Tesla series. The 
technology consortium Khronos Group has released the OpenCL specification, which is a framework for writing programs 
that execute across platforms consisting of CPUs and GPUs. AMD, Apple, Intel, Nvidia and others are supporting OpenCL.
Application-specific integrated circuitsMain article: Application-specific integrated circuit
Several application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) approaches have been devised for dealing with parallel 
applications.[63][64][65]
Because an ASIC is (by definition) specific to a given application, it can be fully optimized for that application. 
As a result, for a given application, an ASIC tends to outperform a general-purpose computer. However, ASICs are 
created by UV photolithography. This process requires a mask set, which can be extremely expensive. A mask set can 
cost over a million US dollars.[66] (The smaller the transistors required for the chip, the more expensive the mask 
will be.) Meanwhile, performance increases in general-purpose computing over time (as described by Moore's law) tend 
to wipe out these gains in only one or two chip generations.[61] High initial cost, and the tendency to be overtaken 
by Moore's-law-driven general-purpose computing, has rendered ASICs unfeasible for most parallel computing 
applications. However, some have been built. One example is the PFLOPS RIKEN MDGRAPE-3 machine which uses custom 
ASICs for molecular dynamics simulation.Vector processorsMain article: Vector processorThe Cray-1 is a vector 
processor.
A vector processor is a CPU or computer system that can execute the same instruction on large sets of data. Vector 
processors have high-level operations that work on linear arrays of numbers or vectors. An example vector operation 
is A = B × C, where A, B, and C are each 64-element vectors of 64-bit floating-point numbers.[67] They are closely 
related to Flynn's SIMD classification.[67]
Cray computers became famous for their vector-processing computers in the 1970s and 1980s. However, vector 
processors—both as CPUs and as full computer systems—have generally disappeared. Modern processor instruction sets do 
include some vector processing instructions, such as with Freescale Semiconductor's AltiVec and Intel's Streaming 
SIMD Extensions (SSE).
Software
Parallel programming languages
Main article: List of concurrent and parallel programming languages
Concurrent programming languages, libraries, APIs, and parallel programming models (such as algorithmic skeletons) 
have been created for programming parallel computers. These can generally be divided into classes based on the 
assumptions they make about the underlying memory architecture—shared memory, distributed memory, or shared 
distributed memory. Shared memory programming languages communicate by manipulating shared memory variables. 
Distributed memory uses message passing. POSIX Threads and OpenMP are two of the most widely used shared memory APIs, 
whereas Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the most widely used message-passing system API.[68] One concept used in 
programming parallel programs is the future concept, where one part of a program promises to deliver a required datum 
to another part of a program at some future time.
Efforts to standardize parallel programming include an open standard called OpenHMPP for hybrid multi-core parallel 
programming. The OpenHMPP directive-based programming model offers a syntax to efficiently offload computations on 
hardware accelerators and to optimize data movement to/from the hardware memory using remote procedure calls.
The rise of consumer GPUs has led to support for compute kernels, either in graphics APIs (referred to as compute 
shaders), in dedicated APIs (such as OpenCL), or in other language extensions.

Automatic parallelization
Main article: Automatic parallelization
Automatic parallelization of a sequential program by a compiler is the "holy grail" of parallel computing, especially 
with the aforementioned limit of processor frequency. Despite decades of work by compiler researchers, automatic 
parallelization has had only limited success.[69]
Mainstream parallel programming languages remain either explicitly parallel or (at best) partially implicit, in which 

a programmer gives the compiler directives for parallelization. A few fully implicit parallel programming languages 
exist—SISAL, Parallel Haskell, SequenceL, SystemC (for FPGAs), Mitrion-C, VHDL, and Verilog.
Application checkpointing
Main article: Application checkpointing
As a computer system grows in complexity, the mean time between failures usually decreases. Application checkpointing 
is a technique whereby the computer system takes a "snapshot" of the application—a record of all current resource 
allocations and variable states, akin to a core dump—; this information can be used to restore the program if the 
computer should fail. Application checkpointing means that the program has to restart from only its last checkpoint 
rather than the beginning. While checkpointing provides benefits in a variety of situations, it is especially useful 
in highly parallel systems with a large number of processors used in high performance computing.[70]Algorithmic 
methodsAs parallel computers become larger and faster, we are now able to solve problems that had previously taken 
too long to run. Fields as varied as bioinformatics (for protein folding and sequence analysis) and economics have 
taken advantage of parallel computing. Common types of problems in parallel computing applications include:[71]
Dense linear algebra
Sparse linear algebra
Spectral methods (such as Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform)
N-body problems (such as Barnes–Hut simulation)
Structured grid problems (such as Lattice Boltzmann methods)
Unstructured grid problems (such as found in finite element analysis)
Monte Carlo method
Combinational logic (such as brute-force cryptographic techniques)
Graph traversal (such as sorting algorithms)
Dynamic programming
Branch and bound methods
Graphical models (such as detecting hidden Markov models and constructing Bayesian networks)
HBJ model, a concise message-passing model[72]
Finite-state machine simulation
Optimization problems (such as genetic algorithms and simulated annealing)
Particle methods (such as particle-in-cell and smoothed particle hydrodynamics)
Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs)
Data mining and pattern recognition
Machine learning and deep learning training
Ray tracing and rendering
Time-series analysis
Streaming data analytics
Fault tolerance
Further information: Fault-tolerant computer system
Parallel computing can also be applied to the design of fault-tolerant computer systems, particularly via lockstep 
systems performing the same operation in parallel. This provides redundancy in case one component fails, and also 
allows automatic error detection and error correction if the results differ. These methods can be used to help 
prevent single-event upsets caused by transient errors.[73] Although additional measures may be required in embedded 
or specialized systems, this method can provide a cost-effective approach to achieve n-modular redundancy in 
commercial off-the-shelf systems.HistoryFor broader coverage of this topic, see History of computing.
ILLIAC IV, "the most infamous of supercomputers"[74]
The origins of true (MIMD) parallelism go back to Luigi Federico Menabrea and his Sketch of the Analytic Engine 
Invented by Charles Babbage.[75][76][77]
In 1957, Compagnie des Machines Bull announced the first computer architecture specifically designed for parallelism, 
the Gamma 60.[78] It utilized a fork-join model and a "Program Distributor" to dispatch and collect data to and from 
independent processing units connected to a central memory.[79][80]
In April 1958, Stanley Gill (Ferranti) discussed parallel programming and the need for branching and waiting.[81] 
Also in 1958, IBM researchers John Cocke and Daniel Slotnick discussed the use of parallelism in numerical 
calculations for the first time.[82] Burroughs Corporation introduced the D825 in 1962, a four-processor computer 
that accessed up to 16 memory modules through a crossbar switch.[83] In 1967, Amdahl and Slotnick published a debate 
about the feasibility of parallel processing at American Federation of Information Processing Societies Conference.
[82] It was during this debate that Amdahl's law was coined to define the limit of speed-up due to parallelism.
In 1969, Honeywell introduced its first Multics system, a symmetric multiprocessor system capable of running up to eight processors in parallel.[82] C.mmp, a multi-processor project at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1970s, was 
among the first multiprocessors with more than a few processors. The first bus-connected multiprocessor with snooping 
caches was the Synapse N+1 in 1984.[76]

SIMD parallel computers can be traced back to the 1970s. The motivation behind early SIMD computers was to amortize 
the gate delay of the processor's control unit over multiple instructions.[84] In 1964, Slotnick had proposed 
building a massively parallel computer for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.[82] His design was funded by 
the US Air Force, which was the earliest SIMD parallel-computing effort, ILLIAC IV.[82] The key to its design was a 
fairly high parallelism, with up to 256 processors, which allowed the machine to work on large datasets in what would 
later be known as vector processing. However, ILLIAC IV was called "the most infamous of supercomputers", because the 
project was only one-fourth completed, but took 11 years and cost almost four times the original estimate.[74] When 
it was finally ready to run its first real application in 1976, it was outperformed by existing commercial supercomputers such as the Cray-1.

On 25 October 2004 McIntyre posted comments on climate2003.com about a piece by William Connolley circulated on
various blogs, and on 26 October wrote, "Maybe I’ll start blogging some odds and ends that I’m working on. I’m going 
to post up some more observations on some of the blog criticisms."[7] On 1 December Michael E. Mann and nine other 
scientists launched the RealClimate website as "a resource where the public can go to see what actual scientists 
working in the field have to say about the latest issues."[8] On climate2003.com McIntyre noted this development in a 
blog post on 10 December, where he wrote "Mann and some of his colleagues have set up a blog at the above address. A 
couple of Mann's first postings have been arguments against our papers. I'll post up a two quick comments below."[7] 
On 2 February 2005 McIntyre set up his Climate Audit blog, having found difficulties with posting comments on the 
climate2003.com layout.[
After the UK Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) came into effect in 2005, Climate Audit readers were asked to make FOI 
requests to the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (UEA) for the raw data from weather 
stations used in developing instrumental temperature record datasets, for copies of agreements under which the raw 
data was obtained from meteorology institutions, and also for email correspondence relating to the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report.[11] On 12 August 2009, Olive Heffernan wrote in naturenews that 
"Since 2002, Steve McIntyre, the editor of Climate Audit, a blog that investigates the statistical methods used in 
climate science, has repeatedly asked Phil Jones, director of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of 

East Anglia, UK, for access to monthly global surface temperature data held by the institute. But in recent weeks, 
Jones has been swamped by a sudden surge in demands for data". She described how CRU had received 58 FOIA requests 
between 24 and 29 July 2009 from McIntyre or others associated with the blog. The raw data was restricted to 
academics, and the unit's director Phil Jones said that the data was subject to confidentiality agreements with 
various governments, but he was seeking agreement to get the raw data available online. He said that “Data release 
needs to be done in a systematic way.”[12]
The site was one of the first to receive word of the e-mails which had been leaked[13][14][15] from the University of 
East Anglia with Jonathan Leake of The Times writing, "The storm began with just four cryptic words. 'A miracle has 
happened,' announced a contributor to Climate Audit, a website devoted to criticising the science of climate change."
[16] Louise Gray wrote in The Daily Telegraph, "Climate Audit was one of the first to post up the stolen emails from 
the University of East Anglia that led to the 'climategate' scandal".[17]
Bloomberg said of the controversy, "Web sites and blogs including the Climate Audit Mirror Site have carried copies 
of e-mails, correspondence between climatologists and commentary. In one e-mail cited widely on blogs including 
Climate Audit, Phil Jones writes about completing “Mike’s nature trick of adding in the real temps” in order to hide 
the decline."[18] According to Antonio Regalado writing in Science Insider, Jones wrote e-mails stating that he 
convinced the university's FOI managers to not release data to "greenhouse skeptics" because Jones believed that they 
planned to harm the UEA or setback climate science by drawing scientists into disputes, wasting research time.[19] 
"Think I've managed to persuade UEA to ignore all further FOIA requests if the people have anything to do with 
Climate Audit," Jones wrote in 2007.[19] The House of Commons' Science and Technology Committee largely vindicated 
the scientists involved in the scandal, but left consideration of the quality of the science and the conduct of the 
research to committees chaired by Lord Oxburgh and Sir Muir Russell. Fox News said that McIntyre "who also worked at 
the IPCC and submitted notes to the Science and Technology Committee for its investigation, wrote a lengthy rebuttal 
of the decision on his blog", and disputed the committee's conclusion that the word trick "appears to be a 
colloquialism for a 'neat' method of handling data".[20] Further investigations by the United States Environmental 
Protection Agency, the Inspector General of the United States Department of Commerce and the Office of the Inspector 
General (OIG) of the National Science Foundation reaffirmed that the accusations against the scientists were
